Lithium is a tool to generate a socially shareable gif from a diff of two snippets of code/config.

## Inspiration

Lithium was inspired by [Shiki Magic Move](https://github.com/rhysd/Shiki-Magic-Move) and [Carbon](https://carbon.now.sh/)/[Ray.so](https://ray.so/).

It was created as part of the [SolidJS Hackathon](https://hack.solidjs.com/)

### Libraries

This project leans heavily on these libraries:

- [Shiki](https://shiki.matsu.io/)
